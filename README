This is the readme of mygb's url shortener.

You set up a domain (you can have multiple domains, they're called as services).
With a token, the user can shorten urls.

This script offers lots of functions like authentication, statistics keeping something simple for the user.
You can have as much languages as you want. It's based on the browser's info.
